# Frontend retail portal
### Description
Mock product details page that dynamically updates with selected product and style. This is my frontend capstone for the Software Engineering Immersive program at Galvanize/Hack Reactor. My part of the project, the product overview module (top most part of page and highlighted in Fig. 1), guides the user through selecting a style and size for a given product.
