# Frontend retail portal
### Description
Mock product details page that dynamically updates with selected product and style. This is my frontend capstone for the Software Engineering Immersive program at Galvanize/Hack Reactor. While this repo contains the entire portal built by my team, this Readme applies only to my part of the project, the product overview module (top most part of page and highlighted in Fig. 1). The overview module guides the user through selecting a style and size for a given product to add to cart. See Credits sections for other modules. The backend/database were pre-built by Galvanize/Hack Reactor.

### Installing
To get a development env running, fork and clone to local machine. From within the root directory, 'npm install' dependencies, then 'npm run react-dev' to get a development build, and 'npm start' to launch the app.

### Usage

### Deployment
I've deployed a production build on an AWS EC2 T2.micro instance here http://18.220.37.180:8000/ .

### Built With
- Webpack
- Babel
- React
- Bootstrap (for pre-defined media queries)

- Trello (for task ticketing)
